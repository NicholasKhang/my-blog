## Introduction

> Welcome to my blog! I started this blog to record my learning and build the library of my learnings so that I could access from anywhere. Nowadays the development stacks are growing ultra fast and it is impossible for us to memorize all the syntax, architecture structure and functions for different frameworks, library or packages.

> This blog is mostly a technical blog and I will share my knowledge and experience on the development stacks, technologies or tools that I used.

## Tools for building this blog

I had been struggled long time on choosing the tools for building this blog. I was thinking to use the external blogging platform such as [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) or [Medium](https://medium.com/) to create my own blog. However, I wish to learn to build a blog site from scratch and publish my blog on my own to my own hosting or domain.

Apart from that, since my primary programming language is PHP, I had also explore [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) as its popularity. Wordpress is a great CMS platform for blogging or create a website. It was written in PHP and paried with a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

However, I feel that is too much for me to maintain my blog as I require to find and maintain my hosting for PHP and database. Therefore, I look for alternative tools that allowed me to build generate a statis webpage so that I can publish my blog on a static site hosting such as [Github Pages](https://github.com/).

## Gridsome

I had learned both 3 champion front-end frameworks [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/), [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) and [AngularJs (Angular1)](https://angularjs.org/). Personally I prefer VueJs so I had make some comparison between some VueJs CMS framework such as [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), [NuxtPress](https://nuxt.press/).

Both these frameworks support static site generator and also have various plugin to support [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. It is very convenient to write my blog post in markdown syntax so I can just blogging with any text editor.

I had choose Gridsome as my final decision to start my blog due to ease of use and the documentation is very complete. I might develop my blog with different tools in the future for my learnings. I will share some of the guides on building this blog with Gridsome in my next post.
